# Paypen

With Paypen, readers can enjoy the flexibility of paying only for the articles they want to read without committing to a subscription. Payment is made directly from the reader to the writer via superfluid streams, with payment based on the number of seconds spent on the article. If the reader finds the article unengaging, they have the option to cancel the streams at any time. The payment process is transparent, thanks to the Paypen smart contract. Additionally, every published article is an NFT stored on the IPFS, ensuring that the writer retains full ownership of their work and can even sell it for a higher price if desired. Writers can trust that they will be fairly compensated without having to rely on the platform, making it a win-win situation for both readers and writers.
